##### My code in the wild

Throughout my education and early professional life, I have utilized the Opensource Community and its endless array of projects; Linux and its distributions, Java, Python, Django, and Git to name a few. These projects have been the bedrock for everything I have built as a software engineer. I created a Jekyll theme for this website www.gearoidoconnor.ie and published it on Github. I recently viewed the repository to see 52 people had forked the repository. When I viewed these repositories and accompanying websites, I was humbled to discover my code was being utilized by so many people with numerous professional backgrounds. For example, a business analyst, physicist, economist, software engineer, blockchain entrepreneur, and student have all built their site using my template. This was my first experience of having open source code I wrote utilized by others.
