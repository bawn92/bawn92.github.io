##### My code in the wild


I didn't create a new operating system, I didn't create a revolutionary application, or I didn't create a groundbreaking framework. However, I did make my own tiny contribution back to the opensource community that I have gained so much from. In 2016 I created a Jekyll theme for this website and published it on Github. I recently viewed the repository to see 52 people had forked the repository and 32 had liked it. 

I was curious to know how these people had been using my website. When I started to view the forked repository, and accompanying websites, I was humbled to see my code in the wild being used by so many people for there own personal blogs. This was my first experience of having code I wrote used outside of a work environment. It was one of the most rewarding moments of the last 8 years I have been coding. I have seen my site template used by a business analyst, physicist, economist, software engineer, blockchain entrepreneur, and student. 

I didn't change the world but I did make a contribution!
