##### My code in the wild


Throughout my education and early professional life, the Opensource Community has been a [    ]. So in 2016, when I created a Jekyll theme for this website gearoidoconnor.ie and published it on Github, I was thrilled to contribute to the community that I have relied on so heavily myself. 

I recently viewed the repository to see 52 people had forked the repository. When I viewed the forked repositories and accompanying websites, I was humbled to discover my code being utilised by so many people. My site template has been used by  numerous people with different professional backgrounds, for example, a business analyst, physicist, economist, software engineer, blockchain entrepreneur and student. This was my first experience having code I wrote used outside of the work environment. It was a highly rewarding moment.
