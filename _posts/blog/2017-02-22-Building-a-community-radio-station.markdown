[Dublin Digital Radio](https://listen.dublindigitalradio.com/) is community run radio station that I help to build with [Barry Owens](http://www.barryowens.net/). The application was built usin the mean stack. We built a batch job to retrieve Mixcloud sets and thier metadata. We built an admin panel to allow DDR staff create artists profiles, update the homepage image & write blog posts along with other minor tasks.
