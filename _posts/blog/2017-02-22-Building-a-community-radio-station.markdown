[Dublin Digital Radio](https://listen.dublindigitalradio.com/) is community run radio station that I help to build with [Barry Owens](http://www.barryowens.net/). It was one of the most satisfying projects I have ever worked on. The designers we worked with to build this
project were incredible and done an outstanding job on the look and feel.
