I love youtube, and I have spent a crazy amount of hours on the platform. The
quality of the content is consistenly getting better and I'm always finding new
channels which I immediatly love (nerdwriter1/DevTips). However I do have some
issues with the platform itself. The main one is with the history page for users. There is a
lack of proper analysis on the videos you have watched.

It really frustrates me that I can view the total number of channels I have
watched and sort them based on number of videos watched or number of hours per
channel. I also always wanted to know the total number of hours I have spent
on the platform too.

I develop a chrome extension which provides the statistics I
felt are missing from the Youtube history page. The tool works by automatically
selecting the load more button on the history page until it has reached the end.
It then parses the data pulling the channels, title, video length and places
these into a hashmap. Once in a hashmap this is save to local storage.
