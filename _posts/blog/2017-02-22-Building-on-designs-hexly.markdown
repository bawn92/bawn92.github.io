##### Hexagon Geomtry

The majority of time for this project went into understanding how to draw a hexagon using Canvas. I have to give
a huge amount of credit Reb Blob Games who wrote an outstanding article on this exact topic. This article gave me 
a massive headstart in creating my libary for Canvas.

When deciding what colour a hexagon should I used the levels in a hexagon to try an indicate the variance in sentiment 
between the words. I start by drawing all the neutral words in the center. The postive words are to the left and negative
to the write. The more postive or negative the word the furture from the center it will be.
