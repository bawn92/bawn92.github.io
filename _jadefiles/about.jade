    p I am a software engineer with experience in large scale web applications, automation, networking, and scripting. I thrive on projects that challenge what I know and which encourage me to master what I don't. I have recently been awarded a first class honors MSc in Software Engineering from UCD. I am an advocate for agile software development practices and have developed and deployed many enterprise applications.
